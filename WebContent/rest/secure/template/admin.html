<div class="alert alert-info">

    You see this table because backend gave you data and template. Otherwise you would be redirected to frontend.
    AngularJS normally does not support lazy loading of controllers and services, but there is task in CC for me to check out requireJs. Therefore frontend code will not be secure. So secure he backend

    <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="item in data">{{item}}</li>
    </ul>

</div>
